# Sample i18n app

## Instructions

Simply install all required packages with `npm install`. To collect all translations, run `npx i18next` which will dump all translatinos in the `public/locales/` directory under their respective languages. If you are using VSCode, it is also recommended to install the [i18n Ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally) extension which will make managing your languages and previewing the strings FAR easier.

You can preview the project by running `npm start` which will open the app in your browser.
